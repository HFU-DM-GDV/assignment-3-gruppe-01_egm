## Installation

The following modules are needed to run the program:
- opencv-python: 4.7.0.72
- numpy: 1.24.3

## Usage

Specify the two images to be used as well as the desired cutoff frequencies for each of them in the file "main.py". Then run it.

The user will be asked if they want to go through a guided transformation process using our user interface. The guided transformation process allows the user to adapt one image to the other which will result in a more convincing effect.
Then the hybrid image is generated and displayed in two sizes.
